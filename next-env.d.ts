// FIX: The original triple-slash directives were removed from this file.
// They were causing "Cannot find type definition file" errors, likely due to
// the types already being included by the Next.js framework's TypeScript configuration.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
